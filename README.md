# Description üñºÔ∏è

***dike*** ( pronounced */Ààda…™kiÀê/*) is an open-source platform combining the fields of **malware analysis** with the one of **artificial intelligence**, more precisely the machine learning subfield.

## Objectives üéØ

At the moment, ***dike*** is capable only of analyzing **Portable Executable** and **Object Linking and Embedding** formats. Besides this limitation, it has three main objectives:
1. **Regression of malice**
2. **Classification in malware families**
3. **Similarity analysis**.

## Features üß∞

The software enables the creation of **analysis pipelines** (named in the context of the platform *models*), which deals with the specific steps of the malware analysis and data engineering:
1. **Dataset management**, where it uses three main sources of labeled PE and OLE files:
    - The open-source dataset [DikeDataset](https://github.com/iosifache/DikeDataset)
    - Accurate results of analysis made by the analysts of the organization in which the platform is set up
    - Results of automatic VirusTotal scans
2. **Features extraction**, in which extractors are used to obtain relevant information such as:
    - Strings
    - Characteristics of the file format
    - Opcodes
    - Windows API calls
    - Macros
3. **Features preprocessing**, where preprocessors are used to transform the features into a more friendly format for the machine learning algorithms
    - Transformations
        - Binarization
        - Discretization
        - Counting (and in a special approach, for categories of opcodes and API calls)
        - Vectorization
        - NGrams
    - Scaling
    - Dimensionality reduction
4. **Training of machine learning models** with included cross-validation and evaluation (regression-wise and classification-wise).

# Important Observation ‚ö†Ô∏è

***dike*** is part of my Bachelor thesis, which aims at demonstrating that the artificial intelligence techniques can improve the malware analysis. The document and the presentation (in Romanian üá∑üá¥ only) can be found in a separate repository that will be made public in the near future.

At the moment, this is the only place where some relevant information can be found:
- Software requirements
- Architecture (more detailed than the description above)
- Testing
- Evaluation
- Further development. 

# Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. Download the script [`manage.sh`](https://github.com/iosifache/dike/blob/main/infrastructure/manage.sh) from the folder `infrastructure`.
2. Obtain a VirusTotal API key.
3. Create and host (on a server which the platform can access) a TGZ archive containing two folders, `ghidra` (with a Ghidra project) and `qiling` (with the dynamically linked libraries needed by Qiling).
4. Run the script and follow the instructions.

## For Private Repositories üôä

If the repository hosting the platform is private, there are two steps that needs to be performed before:
1. Generate an asymmetric key pair via `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "EMAIL_ADDRESS"`, where `EMAIL_ADDRESS` need to be populated with your email address.
2. Add the public one into the GitHub's deployment key section.

## For Administrators üë©‚Äçüíª

A powerful command line interface can be used by the administrators, by running the `dike` command on a leader server. Some available commands are demonstrated in the recording below.

The administrators use also manual editing of YAML files, respecting a schema depending on the context in which the file is used. Some existing files (one per type, only for exampling purposes) has comments to document these schemas as follows:
- [Platform configuration](data/configuration/configuration.yaml)
- [Dataset creation](others/configuration_files/datasets/small_pe.yaml)
- [Model creation](others/configuration_files/models/small_ole.yaml).

## For Other Systems üñ•Ô∏è

Other systems of the organization can use the scan services of the platform, creating HTTP or HTTPS (depending on the configuration) requests to the following **API endpoints**.

| Route                                | Action                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/get_malware_families`              | Retrieves the used malware families.                          |
| `/get_evaluation/MODEL_NAME`         | Retrieves the evaluation of a model.                          |
| `/get_configuration/MODEL_NAME`      | Retrieves the configuration.                                  |
| `/get_features/MODEL_NAME/FILE_HASH` | Retrieves the features of a file from the platform's dataset. |
| `/create_ticket/MODEL_NAME`          | Creates a prediction ticket.                                  |
| `/get_ticket/TICKET_NAME`            | Retrieves the content of a prediction ticket.                 |
| `/publish/MODEL_NAME`                | Publishes for a specific model the results of a scan.         |
